osu!filter
==========
Delete the beatmap difficulties you don't want (yes, delete - moving the maps elsewhere and installing them again in the same spot is a true hassle)

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.x (lol)
- osu! song folder

Usage
-----
`python osufilter.py "/your/song/path/here"`

I would recommend that you move your song directory elsewhere before running the script because osu! does some weird caching.
